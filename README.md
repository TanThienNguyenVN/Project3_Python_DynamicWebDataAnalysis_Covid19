### Project 3: Dynamic Web Data Analysis in Python using Covid19 data on web
- Cleaning, rearranging, mutating, and processing data is all well and good, but – at the end of the day we need to be able to produce and publish outcomes. Creating visualisations is an excellent example of this output, and arranging for the publication of visualisations is key, too. Targetting the WWW as a visualisation delivery mechanism ensures the widest audience for our output. Enabling the dynamic creation of visualisations via a web-based application can also enhance interactions with published outcomes. This project will explores the technologies and techniques used to enable such publications.

- Dataset which is used in this project is downloadable from the Irish Government’s Covid-19 dataset site.

- There are three main parts in this project: 
   - 01. Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas (Load the data, Clean up the data, and Tidy the data)
   - 02. Visualize the data using Pandas, Numpy and Plotly
   - 03. Create an interactive, dynamic web application which showcases the visualisations from Part 02 using Dash, a micro-web framework.

- Now, let's get started
